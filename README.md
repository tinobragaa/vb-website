# Responsiveness 
In my research on responsive web design, I discovered that media queries are a powerful feature in CSS that allow developers to apply different styles based on the device's screen size, orientation, or resolution. By using media queries, I ensured that the website adapts seamlessly to different devices, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

This approach demonstrates that I have not only understood the concept of responsive design but have also successfully applied it to make the website more user-friendly and adaptable to modern devices.
